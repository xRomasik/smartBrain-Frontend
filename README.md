## DESCRIPTION

My first web app. Created only to get familiar with react. \
It fetches 1 API and displays robots accordingly to it.

## QUICK START

Clone the repository using `git clone` command and the repository link. \
`cd` into cloned repository. \
`npm install` all the dependencies. \
Then use `npm start` to start this app. \
Window in your browser should pop up, if not, open http://localhost:3000 in your browser. \
